This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Added [Web3Auth](https://web3auth.io) authentication and blockchain integration.

## Getting Started

> Note: For better experience, please use the pnpm package manager. If you don't
> have it installed in your system, you can install it with the following
> command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
```

If `pnpm` is installed, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
